# Chart Pattern- Three Little Indians- Do they work?

All patterns are nothing but the same concept of support and resistance taken to the next level. My trader friend has asked me once- why do you think support and resistances
work? It was thought provoking. All theories are just the representation of how things work in real world and not the other way around. All chart patterns including
the seemingly simpler ones work because a lot of people believe in them. 

- If they believe 180 days moving average will provide support and put their stop loss around it. They are reinforcing that theory. 
- If they believe price of the stock is overvalued as it has crossed the 3sigma valuation line in day charts. Many traders short the stock and it falls in price. 

If many people believe in a pattern and act decisively it starts to work. On the contrary, opposing forces all know that many belive will act this way. They introduce
irrationality and shake the confidence of traders. How many times have you believed the price was too high and the stock was overbought and yet it kept moving up. It 
happens all the time. 

So lets understand one of the strong chart patterns called- "Three little Indians" and if you should trade this pattern?
