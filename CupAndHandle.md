# The Logic Behind Cup and Handle

William o Neil has explained the concept of Cup and Handle in his famous book. He has used for decades to identify the best times to buy a stock. It worked tremendously well
for him and he goes on to teach the same through number of charts. I want to revisit the concept here, but we will focus more on why such patterns work. 

Let's first understand that all chart patterns are mere represetantion of the underlying dynamics of market participants. None of the chart patterns alone can make you rich unless
you understand the implicit dynamics and how it all works. Let's first take the relatively simple ones before dwell deeply into "Cup and Handle".

- Doji: They don't have any body or a slim body and wider whiskers. This indicates bulls and bears are in deadlock. Their actions don't have conviction. Or, there are equal 
     number of bulls and bears (multiplied by respective their order quantity) on the current underlying. It means the same thing. There is confusion on the real value. Now, depending on 
     where the doji occurs and other market indicators, traders take positions.

- Bullish Harami: Let's ignore the weird name for now. But the concept is very strong. The current day pattern's body completely merges inside the body of the previous day's chart body. 
                  This happens when the opening for the current day is below he closing of the previous day and then it start to move up rather than continuing to move down. Why that happens? 
                  Market participants believe the price should not be this less and when it opens low they decide to buy aggressively. Now once again depending on the volume and where in the trend line, the patterns
                  occurs, position can be taken. 

They are the most commonly used chart patterns for short term trading patterns. Cup and Handle is more powerful when used in long term investment but the concept remains the same. 

Let's look at the below pattern for the cup and Handle. 


Let's now analyze what all is happening and how can we construe this to be the right trigger point to buy for a long term gains:
