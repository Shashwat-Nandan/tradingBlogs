# How trading works?

In this blog series, I attempt to explain some of less understood concepts of trading. Plus, there are some lesser known concepts which are kept under the hood, hidden
from the masses as they are the path to riches if mastered correctly. But they are difficult to master and take months & years of practice to be able to spot and exploit
them. 

Trading is an equal art and science. It is the only place which is driven entirely by the emotions of human beings and a chart cannot help you master it. You have to 
own the skills of smelling the winds and knowing if it will rain or not. Even then, you can only speculate and there are no guarantees. Human emotion is a complex process and 
it changes so soon that you have to sense the danger. 

If you have ever traded, you know what I mean. The first rule of trading says: Do not lose money! Some say cut your losses. It is one and same thing. Once you learn 
not to lose money, you have taken the first step towards learning to trade. I will explain several theories and their applications in this blog series.
