# Common Traps in Options Trading

Options trading is a very popular tool because of the leverage it provides. Leverage is a double edged sword and you must have heard it before. That's a topic for another
day. We want to discuss today the common traps in Options trading designed to lure new/naive traders to a wrong trade. 

Firstly, lets get one thing very clear. Rewards in trading is huge and hence there are forces who design systems to trap other traders and profit from them. Afterall, 
it is a zero sum game.So you cannot blame them entirely. It is not a fair game. Some one has to lose for someone else to win! Therefore, you have to not only see what is 
there is front of you but also if this is what someone wants you to see! Let that sink in. Trading is difficult not only because it is hard to read the market 
but more because it is so hard to read the market participants.

So before you enter the world of options trading, you will have to master both. Otherwise all your knowledge, theories and training will all be for nothing. Some of the 
commong traps are following:
## Skewing the order book: 

This is a classic trap and one that is so common that it feels boring now. But they keep doing it and it works always. Someone always takes 
  the bait. Have you ever observed the order book for a up trending stock? Many times, the bid total is much less than ask total and yet the stocks keeps moving up. 
  You wonder who is buying this? This mostly happens when the stock just started trending and a bigger force (FPI, some MF, some large PMS) wants to cover it tracks. Once
  everyone knows that they see huge upside potential in the stock, everyone else moves to the bandwagon. So you want to buy a massive quantity of the stock without disturbing
  the prices much. 
  
  Something similar happens in the options order book but for a different reason.
