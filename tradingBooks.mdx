# Best Trading books

Trading is a continuous process of learning & relearning. There are many books in the market which will teach you a lot about technical analysis and many patterns
which will applied to market scenario, gives profitable results less than 50% of the time. So tossing a coin to decide a trade is better than applying these techniques. 
But the best books that I have read, they don't teach you to apply any such techniques but they tell you how to do the following more skillfully:
- When to get out of trade?
- When to let you profits run?
- Position sizing

So they focus on YOU. This is the most important part of trading and once you know how you act in different situations, you can start to trade with any trading system and 
earn profits. 

The following books are some of my favorites:
