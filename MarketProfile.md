# How to use Market Profile to trade profitably

Market Profile was first developed by Peter Steidlmayer. They are an approach to study the behaviour of market for last couple of days and based on that analysis decide
further course of action. 
Market profile is a histogram chart of "batched time" vs price. Price is plotted on the Y axis and batched time on the X axis. This is very different from the charts which we are 
very used to seeing where time is continuous variable. Market Profile attempts to understands the fair value of a stock via peeking at the amount of time it spends 
on a particular price. The price at which the stock/ commodity/ index spends the most time is referred to as the Time Price Opportunity (TPO). This is considered the fair
value of that underlying for that day. 
  
You can compare this to any everyday example as well. Suppose you have gone to the market to buy an item whose fair value is not known to you. All market participants
are buying the same based on their utility for the product and price asked by the seller. But there is a wide range of the price by the same seller. You decided to 
wait and observe the price & customer's buying behaviour to understand the fair value of the product. The seller keeps changing the price based on the demand dynamically. 
You also observe, the prices kept moving during the day and suddenly at a certain price there were no buyers and the shopkeeper had to reduce the price to restore balance. 
  
You meticulosly plotted the activity for the several days observations and to your surprise, it turned out to be a normal curve. If you had continued your study for a month, you
probably will observe following things:

1. You can observe a normal curve on several specific day. 
2. The fair value or the mean of the curve was rising every day Indicating the item was in good demand and it was a trending market for it. 
3. You also observed, on several days when the prices were not moving down, it stopped moving down below certain prices. 
4. On most days it was testing an upper boundary prices but was failing to close at the top. It felt like range extension when you look the curve for multi day analysis 
now.
  
Something similar happens in the stock market. When you observe things with a bird's eye view, you will observe the price movements were following some behaviour. It 
was erratic on several days but the medium term pattern could be traced from the study.
