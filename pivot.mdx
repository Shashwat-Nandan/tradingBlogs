<h1>Importance of Pivot lines in Trading</h1>

Traders rely on number of different Technical studies to reveal the market behaviour and take favorable position for themselves. There are many technical studies
like MACD, Bollinger bands, RSI, Moving Averages (simple, exponential etc), RENKO chart etc. So what makes Pivot lines any special among the variety of tools already
at the disposal. Well, they are not special and neither promises to be so. Like all other chart patterns, they don't tell us anything if used alone. But when you 
club it with couple of other live market Indicators, you will have a tool which can take your trading skills to next level.

Pivot lines tells us following things about the market:
- Pivot lines simply take the price activity of previous day and attempts to tell us the value range for the succeeding day.
- Value range also indicates if the stock/ index will be on trend today or rangebound. (If you are not sure about the different market behaviours and why they occur,
